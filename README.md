Random assortment of TikTok animation code, like the 4D cube animation, Parabola perspective animation, and the barycentric (triangle interpolation) animation.

The reason this is public is so others might take inspiration from my work and possibly learn from it. Please do NOT blatantly copy it and render out the animation to post on your own social media, or I'll stop making these codes public, and throw a banana at you.
